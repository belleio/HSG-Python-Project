Description

Use NHL players data set to build a model (e.g. multivariate regression) in Python based on which we try to predict the player's salary (as a proxy for the player's value) based on some regressors we choose from the data set. This provides the basis for a "scouting program" that users can basically query like a database.

Requirements (still partially tbd)

- Let user's query for a player name with the output being the value that the program computes based on stats, their actual salary and the % difference between the two (over/undervalued).

- Let users input certain variables (e.g. age, goals scored, etc) and our program outputs the value for such a player. 

- Filter for a players name to then see his value (including under/overpayed). 

- Combine it also with other filters (age, team, position, certain stats, etc.).

- Outputs delivered according to the entered filters ordered according to one certain filter (for example showing the most underpaid players first).

- Need a code for filtering strings (name), one for different categories (position, hand, etc.), one for integers (age, stats, etc.) and then maybe something to order integers.
